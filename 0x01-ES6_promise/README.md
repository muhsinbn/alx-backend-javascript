## Introduction

This project covers the basics of ES6 Promises. Promises are an essential feature of modern JavaScript that allow for better management of asynchronous operations. This repository includes exercises and examples to help understand how Promises work, how to create them, and how to handle their resolved and rejected states.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept of a Promise in JavaScript
- Create and manage Promises
- Use `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` methods
- Chain Promises for sequential asynchronous operations
- Handle multiple Promises with `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`, and `Promise.allSettled()`

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `taskFirst.js`: Demonstrates the use of `const` for variable declaration.
- `taskNext.js`: Demonstrates the use of `let` for variable declaration.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
