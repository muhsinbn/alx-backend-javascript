## Introduction
This project is focused on implementing and understanding unit tests in JavaScript. It aims to help developers create high-quality, maintainable code by writing automated tests for functions and modules.

Unit testing is crucial in modern software development. By using testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, or Jest, you can ensure that your code works as expected and catches bugs early in the development process.
