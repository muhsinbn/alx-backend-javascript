## Introduction

This project focuses on the concepts and usage of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) classes in JavaScript. ES6 introduced a class syntax for JavaScript, which is a more intuitive and cleaner way to work with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript. This project includes examples and exercises that demonstrate how to create classes, use constructors, extend classes with inheritance, and work with static methods and getters/setters.

## Learning Objectives
 
* How to define a Class
* How to add methods to a class
* Why and how to add a static method to a class
* How to extend a class from another
* Metaprogramming and symbols
